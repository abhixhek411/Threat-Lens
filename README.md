ThreatLens: AI-Powered Cyber Threat Analyzer

ThreatLens is a powerful web application designed to help cybersecurity professionals and IT administrators quickly analyze suspicious digital artifacts like logs, emails, and domains. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), it provides real-time risk assessments and actionable remediation steps, turning complex threat data into clear, understandable insights.

‚ú® Features
Real-time AI Analysis: Instantly analyze suspicious data snippets and receive an AI-generated risk summary.

Actionable Remediation: Get clear, bulleted remediation steps to help you respond to threats effectively.

Modern Tech Stack: Built with a robust and scalable stack using React, Tailwind CSS, Appwrite, and integrated with Groq/OpenAI API for lightning-fast AI processing.

üöÄ Planned Features (Roadmap)
We are actively developing new features to make ThreatLens an even more essential tool:

Geo-IP Detection & Localization: Integrate geo-IP detection to pinpoint the origin of attacks. This will include India-specific threat tagging to provide localized context and awareness.

AbuseIPDB Integration: Connect with the AbuseIPDB API to assign severity scores to suspicious IP addresses, providing a more reliable measure of potential threats.

Browser Extension: Develop a lightweight browser extension to bring real-time analysis directly to your browser, allowing for on-the-fly threat assessment without leaving your current workflow.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

Backend & Database: Appwrite

AI APIs: Groq, OpenAI

Deployment: (Specify your deployment platform, e.g., Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
